# PhotoGallery
PhotoGallery is a client for the photo-sharing site Flickr. It will fetch and display the most recent
public photos uploaded to Flickr.
The user gets to the flickr page on clicking the image and can check the recent uploads of their choice as well.
This app is built using the api key provided by flickr. Network programming is the heart of the project. Search, services, notifications, broadcast
receivers, and web views are the other features of the project.
